# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Every architectural decision gets an entry here BEFORE or WITH the code that implements it.
Newest at the bottom. Never delete an entry; if a decision changes, add a new ADR that supersedes the old one
and change the old one's status to `Superseded by ADR-00N`.

Status values: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Rejected

## ADR-001: Use the hackathon plan's stack (Python 3.12, FastAPI, Bicep, Container Apps, GHCR)
- **Date:** 2026-10-28
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The LiveFire Fusion PoC Implementation Plan fixes the stack so all five workstreams integrate.
- **Options considered:** (1) follow the plan; (2) substitute tools we know better.
- **Decision:** Follow the plan, including the pinned versions in the WS1 Build Guide's `requirements.txt`.
  Deviations require a new ADR and the lead's approval.
- **Consequences:** Less freedom, but WS2–WS5 can rely on our names, outputs and image tag.
- **Implemented in:** PR #1

## ADR-002: Host the shared repo in a GitHub org, public
- **Date:** 2026-10-28
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The Build Guide (Phase 0) asks for "a repo in an org the team controls" shared by WS1 and WS2, and
  says to decide early whether the image package can be public. The PoC plan lists "which org, public or private"
  as an open question. No team repo existed yet.
- **Options considered:** (1) new free org `livefire-team`, public repo; (2) repo under a personal account;
  (3) private repo (Bandit instead of CodeQL, registry credentials in the Container App).
- **Decision:** Create the free org `livefire-team` and the public repo `livefire-team/livefire-fusion-poc`.
  The image will be `ghcr.io/livefire-team/order-service` (lowercase, as GHCR requires) and its package public.
- **Consequences:** Free CodeQL; Container Apps pulls the image with no registry credential, so `twin.bicep` stays
  simple. Ownership is not tied to one person (more org admins can be added). Anyone can read the code and the
  commit history, including the seeded demo bug — acceptable because the repo holds no secrets and is a demo.
  Teammates must be invited to the org/repo before they can push.
- **Implemented in:** PR #1 (repo created 2026-10-28)

## ADR-003: Merge commits only — never squash or rebase-merge
- **Date:** 2026-10-28
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The demo relies on two separate seed commits in `main` (the secret provider without the bug, then the
  `perf(order-service): cache secret failures...` commit). The Investigator agent finds the clue in that history.
  A squash merge would collapse them into one commit and destroy the clue.
- **Options considered:** (1) squash merges (tidy history); (2) rebase merges; (3) merge commits only.
- **Decision:** Merge every PR with a merge commit (`gh pr merge <N> --merge`). Never force-push `main`.
  Disable squash and rebase merging in the repo settings so nobody can do it by accident.
- **Consequences:** History is noisier (one merge commit per PR) but every commit survives exactly as written.
- **Implemented in:** PR #1 (repo settings change applied with the owner's approval)

## ADR-004: Keep the spec documents out of the repo
- **Date:** 2026-10-28
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The starter prompt asked for the Build Guide and PoC plan under `docs/reference/`. The Build Guide
  explains the demo's fault in detail. The repo is public (ADR-002), and the Planner agent's
  `read_repository_context` tool reads allowlisted repo paths. Either way the answer would sit next to the code,
  while the guardrail says the clue must live only in git history.
- **Options considered:** (1) commit them and rely on WS3's allowlist excluding `docs/`; (2) keep them only in the
  local kit folder and git-ignore `docs/reference/`.
- **Decision:** Option 2. The specs stay in `C:\Users\venka\projects\livefire-ws1-kit\reference\`; `CLAUDE.md`
  points there. WS3 must also keep `docs/` and `CLAUDE.md` off the agent allowlist, because they name the
  guardrails.
- **Consequences:** A new laptop or teammate needs the kit folder (or the PDFs) separately. The demo cannot be
  spoiled by reading the repo's spec copies.
- **Implemented in:** PR #1

## ADR-00N: <short title>
- **Date:**
- **Status:** Proposed
- **Context:** What problem or constraint forces a decision?
- **Options considered:** (1) … (2) … (3) …
- **Decision:** What we chose, in one or two sentences.
- **Consequences:** Good and bad results, what it makes harder later.
